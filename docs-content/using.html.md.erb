This topic describes how to bind your Application to an AppInternals service instance and start collecting data.


## <a id='bind'></a> Pivotal Apps Manager: Binding the Application to the AppInternals Service

Use the Pivotal Apps Manager to bind an application to the AppInternals service instance. Creating the service instance is only done once after the initial installation (and each upgrade) of AppInternals as described in [Installing and Configuring AppInternals](installing.html#service).

1. Log in to the Pivotal Apps Manager and navigate to your application.

1. Select your application instance and click on the **Services** tab.

1. Click on **BIND SERVICE**.
    <%= image_tag("bindService1.png") %>

1. In the **Service to Bind** list, select the AppInternals service instance you created.

1. There are no parameters to add. Leave the **Add Parameters** area empty.

1. Click **CREATE**.
    <%= image_tag("bindService2.png") %>

1. Confirm that the application is now bound to the service:

## <a id='envvars'></a> Environment Variables per Application 

Before restaging your application, you can add environment variables to it to tailor certain things.

<table class="nice">
    <th>Env Variable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <tr>
        <td>RVBD_APP_CONFIG</td>
        <td>The AppInternals Config name, as seen in the Analysis Server UI. <br>This overrides the one specified in [configuration of the AppInternals tile](installing.html#config).<br>Make sure the name is spelled correctly to match an existing config on the Analysis Server.<br>If the name has spaces in it, replace them with + signs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>RVBD_APP_INSTANCE</td>
        <td>A meaningful instance name to use for the application, to override the default.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

There are a couple of ways to set an environment variable, such as adding it to the application's manifest file, or using the cf command line.

Here's how to do it by hand with the `cf set-env` command:

    C:\testapps\spring-music-master>cf set-env spring-music-doctest RVBD_APP_CONFIG my-config-name

A more reliable way is to add this definition to the `env` block of the application's manifest file, as follows:

    ---
    applications:
    - name: my-app
      env:
        RVBD_APP_CONFIG: my-config-name

You must `cf restage` your app after setting env variables.


## <a id='jbp'></a> Java Buildpack

Make sure you're using at least **JBP version 4.18 or higher**. Earlier versions are not supported.

## <a id='restage'></a> Restaging the Application 
The `cf restage` command recreates the application so that it will be monitored by AppInternals. Specify the application name (`spring-music-doctest` in this example).  

    C:\testapps\spring-music-master>cf restage spring-music-doctest
    Restaging app spring-music-doctest in org riverbed / space qa as admin...

## <a id='confirm'></a> Enjoy Your Data!

After you restage the application, the AppInternals analysis server will automatically harvest performance data. In a few minutes, transaction data for your instrumented applications will appear in the AppInternals interface.

1. Log in to the analysis server specified during [configuration of the AppInternals tile](installing.html#config).

1. The **Instances** tab will show transactions from the newly-monitored application.
