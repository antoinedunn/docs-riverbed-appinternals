## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Riverbed® SteelCentral AppInternals™ for PCF monitors Java applications running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry v1.2 or v2.0 environment.  

This documentation describes installing the AppInternals Service Broker tile for PCF and configuring applications to start with AppInternals monitoring.  

AppInternals agents instrument and monitor Java applications to capture every application transaction.  In addition, the agent collects key operating system metrics for VM hosts (Diego/compute cells) where application containers are running. 

The AppInternals analysis server harvests, processes, and displays this data, giving you immediate insight into application performance problems.

The *AppInternals for PCF* tile includes the Riverbed AppInternals Service Broker and the BOSH add-on for the AppInternals Agent.  Install and configure the tile to deploy the agent on PCF VM hosts (additional steps are required for PCF v1.12).  Then, push each application you want to monitor to PCF and bind it to the AppInternals service instance.  

<%= image_tag("architecture.png") %>

One-time steps in the PCF environment:

1. In the PCF Ops Manager, [import the tile] (installing.html#install) 
1. In the PCF Ops Manager, [configure the tile] (installing.html#config) to specify connection details for the analysis server that will host the agent data
1. In the Pivotal Apps Manager, [create an instance of the AppInternals service] (installing.html#service) 

Steps for each application (repeat these steps when the application changes):

1. In your development environment or staging area, [use the Cloud Foundry CLI to push the application] (using.html#push) from your environment to PCF
1. [Bind the application] (using.html#bind) to the AppInternals service instance
1. In your development environment or staging area, [use the Cloud Foundry CLI to restage the application] (using.html#restage)
