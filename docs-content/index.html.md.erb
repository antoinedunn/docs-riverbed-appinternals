# <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Riverbed® SteelCentral AppInternals™ for PCF monitors Java applications running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry v1.2 or v2.0 environment.  

This documentation describes installing the AppInternals Service Broker tile for PCF and configuring applications to start with AppInternals monitoring.  

AppInternals agents instrument and monitor Java applications to capture every application transaction.  
In addition, the agent collects key operating system metrics for VM hosts (Diego/compute cells) where application containers are running. 

The AppInternals analysis server harvests, processes, and displays this data, giving you immediate insight into application performance problems.  

See the following links for more information on AppInternals:

* [Product overview](https://www.riverbed.com/products/steelcentral/steelcentral-appinternals.html)

* [Product documentation](http://doc.steelcentral.net/)

<!-- AppInternals delivers scalable, high-definition application 
performance monitoring and analytics with deep visibility into transactions, containers and services. 
AppInternals uses a big data approach to capture and store every transaction and its associated metadata. 
AppInternals also captures system and container data at 1 second intervals. With this, you get immediate 
insight into application performance problems, even for infrequent or intermittent issues, and a 
cost-effective, scalable solution for all your web and mobile application monitoring needs.

* **Application Performance Insights**
Trace every transaction from user to back-end. Understand app dependencies, or expose 
and fix even the most hard-to-detect code, SQL, network or web services problems quickly.

* **Network & Infrastructure Diagnostics**
Continuously monitor your dynamic infrastructure. See their impact on your apps and 
vice versa. Resolve resource utilization and network-related errors before users are impacted.

* **User Experience & Business Insights**
Understand your users’ satisfaction and trends in real-time. Identify your application’s 
best and least used features, and quantify its financial impact on business results.

To monitor applications, follow these steps:

* In the PCF Ops Manager:
  * [Import the tile] (installing.html#install) 
  * [Configure the service broker] (installing.html#config) to specify agent settings, including the analysis server that will host the agent data

<!--   See [Installing and Configuring AppInternals](installing.html) for details. -->

* In your development environment or staging area, use the Cloud Foundry CLI to push an application from your environment to PCF
  
* In the Pivotal Apps Manager:
  * Create an instance of the AppInternals service (if necessary)
  * Bind the application to the Appinternals service instance

* In your development environment or staging area, use the Cloud Foundry CLI to restage the application
