## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

This documentation describes how to install Aternity® APM for VMware Tanzu and configure 
applications to start using APM monitoring.  

APM agents instrument and monitor .NET Core  and Java applications to capture every application transaction. In addition, the agent collects key operating system metrics for VM hosts (Diego/compute cells) where application containers are running. 

The APM analysis server harvests, processes, and displays this data, giving you immediate insight into application performance problems.  

See the following links for more information on APM:

* [Product documentation](http://doc.steelcentral.net/)

Aternity® APM  for VMware Tanzu includes an Aternity APM Service Broker and a 
BOSH add-on for the APM Agent. 
Install and configure the tile to deploy the agent on VMware Tanzu VM hosts. Create an APM service instance. Then, bind each application you want to monitor to the APM service instance.  

<%= image_tag("architecture.png") %>

One-time steps in the VMware Tanzu environment:

1. In VMware Tanzu Ops Manager, [import the tile](installing.html#install).
1. In VMware Tanzu Ops Manager, [configure the tile](installing.html#config) to specify connection details for the analysis server that will host the agent data.
1. In Pivotal Apps Manager, [create an instance of the APM service](installing.html#service).

Steps for each application (repeat these steps when the application changes):

1. [Set Environment Variables](using.html#envvars) for the application, usually in its manifest.
1. [Bind the application](using.html#bind) to the APM service instance.
1. [Restage](using.html#restage) the application.
