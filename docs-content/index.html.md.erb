## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

This documentation describes how to install Riverbed® SteelCentral AppInternals for PCF and configure 
applications to start using AppInternals monitoring.  

AppInternals agents instrument and monitor .NetCore  and Java applications to capture every application transaction. In addition, the agent collects key operating system metrics for VM hosts (Diego/compute cells) where application containers are running. 

The AppInternals analysis server harvests, processes, and displays this data, giving you immediate insight into application performance problems.

Riverbed® SteelCentral AppInternals™ for PCF includes a Riverbed AppInternals Service Broker and a 
BOSH add-on for the AppInternals Agent. 
Install and configure the tile to deploy the agent on PCF VM hosts. Create an AppInternals service instance. Then, bind each application you want to monitor to the AppInternals service instance.  

<%= image_tag("architecture.png") %>

One-time steps in the PCF environment:

1. In PCF Ops Manager, [import the tile](installing.html#install).
1. In PCF Ops Manager, [configure the tile](installing.html#config) to specify connection details for the analysis server that will host the agent data.
1. In Pivotal Apps Manager, [create an instance of the AppInternals service](installing.html#service).

Steps for each application (repeat these steps when the application changes):

1. [Set Environment Variables](using.html#envvars) for the application, usually in its manifest.
1. [Bind the application](using.html#bind) to the AppInternals service instance.
1. [Restage](using.html#restage) the application.
